# Data_Structures_exercises
Some Data Structure exercises from the discipline Data Structures held on 02/2019. Over time, I lost most of the works and exercises I did for this discipline, but I managed to recover these. They are all mostly in Portuguese.

In the file "Queue.c" I had to make a Queue structure (as the name implies) but using two stacks. I ask the user to type a chain of characters that will compose the queue. Next, I ask for 2 pieces of informations: which element the user wants to find and in what position he wants to see the content. There's a simple check-up to see if the information is valid, the program will tell you if it isn't. In the end, I show the queue content in order.

Similarly, in the file "Stack.c" I had to make a Stack structure (as the name implies) but using two queues. The rest is equal to the Queue.c file considering a queue instead of a stack.
